# Exercise 1.1
## Question
What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizerâ€™s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?

## Answer
### The thinking
* The team has to understand that testing can show the presence, but not the absence of failures.
* Reducing risk is the ultimate goal of the project. Therefore, test engineers can become technical leaders of the project.

### The plan
* Primary responsibility to measure and improve software quality
* Testers and developers should cooperate to reduce risk
